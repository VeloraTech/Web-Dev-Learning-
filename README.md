# Web Development Journey

Welcome to my personal web development learning repository!

This repo is where I document my growth as a web developer. I'm currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by building simple projects like landing pages and experimenting with new ideas as I improve.

## ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Inside

- ðŸ“„ index.html â€“ My first landing page layout  
- ðŸŽ¨ style.css â€“ Styling for the landing page  
- ðŸ§  script.js â€“ Basic JavaScript for interaction  
- More updates coming as I continue learning!

## ðŸ“Œ Why I Created This Repo

I'm passionate about becoming a skilled software developer. Having a better system would help me code more efficiently, and this repository is part of my journey to show consistent effort and growth.

Stay tuned for more projects and improvements!
